Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One area that is exciting in data science is focused around wearable comuting. In this study, teh data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The goal here is to prepare  tdiy data taht we can be used for later analysis.

Here are the data for the project:

CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

Tidy_Data.txt - product of this exercise, which contains the output after going through the above excercise. 

run_analysis.R - performs the below steps:

  -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

  -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

  -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

  -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

  -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
